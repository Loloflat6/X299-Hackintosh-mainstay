# X299-Hackintosh-mainstay
X299 Hackintosh support
## Introduction
The X299 Hackintosh mainstay repo is made to keep the support of these motherboards alive and up to date.
Three years ago, development began to manage the installation of MacOS on the new Intel-based HEDT platform.
Since then, hard work has been done over the months to keep the hardware and software on the top.
